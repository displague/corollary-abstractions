# Discoveries

Cross-discipline identities found *mechanically* by the matchers — parked
here as they are identified, for separate analysis. Each entry: the claim in
plain language, the structural evidence, and status. Grows over time; the
ledger of record is `reports/signature_matches.json` and
`reports/specializations.json`.

Statuses: **exact** (typed twin or reciprocal equivalence in the corpus),
**family** (twin after sign/parameter absorption), **shape** (structure
matches, slot roles differ), **specialization** (general→specific with
bindings), **near-miss** (informative failure, kept deliberately).

---

- **Coulomb's law is Newtonian gravitation.** Same typed skeleton
  `?V = ?P·?V·?V / ?V²` — inverse-square pair coupling; only the names of
  the charges differ. *exact* (2026-08-06)

- **The quantity theory of money is the ideal gas law with its dimensional
  constant suppressed.** `M·V = P·Q` ⊑ `P·V = n·R·T` with bindings
  MONEY→PRESSURE, VELOCITY→VOLUME, PRICE_LEVEL→AMOUNT,
  OUTPUT→CONSTANT·TEMPERATURE. *specialization* (2026-08-07)

- **Compound interest, population growth, and radioactive decay are one
  law.** `?V = ?P·EXP(?P·?V)` after absorbing the decay sign into the free
  rate parameter; at the sign-exact level the family splits into exactly
  the two semantically correct pairs (compounding↔growth,
  discounting↔decay). *family* (2026-08-07)

- **Hooke's law joins Newton's second law, Ohm's law, and circle
  circumference** as one scaled-linear response family once its restoring
  sign is absorbed into stiffness. *family* (2026-08-07)

- **The laws of logic and the laws of sets are one Boolean algebra.** All
  seven lattice laws (De Morgan, distributivity, involution, absorption,
  identity, complement, idempotence) are exact twins over two carriers,
  recorded as reciprocal equivalences. *exact* (2026-08-07)

- **Shannon entropy is Gibbs entropy.** One skeleton
  `?V = −(?P · Σᵢ ?Vᵢ·log ?Vᵢ)`; Boltzmann's k_B and information's 1/ln 2
  land in the same parameter slot — the disciplines differ by a unit
  choice. *exact* (2026-08-07)

- **pH is the surprisal of proton activity.** `pH = −log(activity)` and
  `surprisal = −log(probability)` are typed twins — chemistry has been
  measuring an information quantity all along. Unplanned; found because
  both corpora made honest independent slot declarations. *exact*
  (2026-08-07)

- **A tangent-line linearization is an affine location-scale transform.**
  Calculus's local approximation and statistics' standardization are one
  structure `?V = ?P + ?P·?V`; CAPM and the Keynesian consumption function
  are members too. *exact* (2026-08-06/07)

- **Rate-of-change, speed, density, molarity, and elasticity are one
  ratio archetype** across calculus, physics, chemistry, and economics.
  *exact* (2026-08-06/07)

- **Entropy inclusion-exclusion is set-cardinality inclusion-exclusion**
  (Yeung's I-measure): `H(X∪Y) = H(X)+H(Y)−H(X∩Y)` matches
  `|A∪B| = |A|+|B|−|A∩B|` exactly. *exact* (2026-08-07)

- **Beer-Lambert absorbance generalizes the whole scaled-linear family**
  (set absorptivity to 1) and typed-twins triangle area — a scaled
  bilinear product is one thing whether it measures light attenuation or
  plane regions. *specialization / exact* (2026-08-07)

- **E = mc² is a geometric scaled-quadratic with the roles swapped.** It
  shape-twins circle area / sphere surface (`? = ?·?²`), but the squared
  quantity is the *constant* — the typed layer correctly refuses the
  identification while the shape layer records the kinship. *shape*

## Informative near-misses (kept deliberately)

- **Textbook mutual information does not twin its own I-measure form** —
  call heads are read literally. Shows precisely what adopting a shared
  abstraction (lattice heads) buys. (2026-08-07)

- **Inclusion-exclusion does not twin total probability.** Applying a
  non-idempotent functional (CARD) to idempotent lattice operations is
  what *manufactures* the correction term — the deliberate counterweight
  to idempotence. (2026-08-07)

- **Uniform entropy = Shannon at p=1/N is invisible to the matcher** —
  collapsing a sum is a rewrite, not slot absorption. Same substitution
  takes Gibbs to Boltzmann's S = k·ln W. First motivated test case for a
  rewrite-edge engine. (2026-08-07)

- **Modus ponens does not twin subset transitivity** — same detachment
  shell, different premise heads; LEQ chosen so hypothetical syllogism
  will twin for free when authored. (2026-08-07)
