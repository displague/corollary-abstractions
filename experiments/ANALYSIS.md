# Overnight experiment analysis — 2026-08-07 morning

## Setup

Synthetic algebra world (`exprgen.py`): random expression trees rendered to
disguised ASCII (random names, commutative shuffles, `-`/`/` sugar, redundant
parens), labels verified by independent numeric evaluation (0 label errors in
audit). Two binary tasks, 50k train / 5k val / 5k test pairs each, plus a 3k
OOD split of *deeper* trees (depth 5-6 vs 2-4 trained):

- **twins**: same canonical skeleton under disguise? (tests whether a model
  can learn the canonicalization our symbolic front-end does exactly)
- **equiv**: equal modulo algebraic rewrites (distribute/factor, identity
  elements, power expansion)? Canonicalization alone cannot solve this.

One architecture for all arms — 4-layer transformer encoder, d=128,
~880k params — only the tokenization differs:

| arm | front-end does | vocab |
|---|---|---|
| char | nothing (raw ASCII) | 67 |
| struct | lex + parse (surface order kept) | 22 |
| canon | lex + parse + canonicalize | 22 |

## Milestone 2 (compression): PASSED

Mean sequence length, twins train split: char 104.4 -> struct 45.7 ->
canon 38.9 tokens. Concept-structured encoding is **2.7x shorter** than
characters on identical content.

## Milestone 3 (equal-size accuracy): twins task complete

| arm | test acc | OOD acc | train time |
|---|---|---|---|
| char | 0.562 | 0.499 | 574s |
| struct | 0.668 | 0.577 | 164s |
| canon | 0.709 | 0.598 | 125s |

Reading:

- The 880k-param char model barely beats chance in-distribution and is
  **exactly at chance (0.499) on deeper expressions** — it memorized surface
  statistics, learned no algebra. Each front-end increment adds real
  accuracy (+10.5 pts parse, +4.1 pts canonicalize) and transfers to OOD.
- Training cost fell 4.6x from char to canon for the same epochs — shorter
  sequences are quadratically cheaper under attention.
- Honest caveat: no arm *solved* twins at this size. 0.709 is far from the
  ~1.0 the symbolic front-end gets for free (canonical skeletons decide
  twins exactly). The experiment argues the design doc's division of labor:
  spend exact symbolic computation where it is exact, spend weights only on
  what has no closed form.

## equiv task (throttled rerun, batch 128): complete

| arm | test acc | OOD acc |
|---|---|---|
| char | 0.667 | 0.565 |
| struct | 0.742 | 0.652 |
| canon | 0.738 | 0.626 |

Reading — this is the informative negative result of the suite:

- Parsing is the universally load-bearing front-end step (+7.5 pts over
  char, and char is no longer at chance here because rewrite artifacts
  leave surface cues).
- **Canonicalization does NOT help on equiv** (tied on test, 2.6 pts worse
  OOD). It pays only when the task *is* canonicalization (twins: +4.1).
  Pre-normalizing can even destroy alignment cues a learner exploits.
  Design consequence: the symbolic front-end should expose *both* the
  surface parse and the canonical form as inputs, not replace one with the
  other — normalization is a query-time tool, not a universal encoding.

## Size reduction (accuracy-vs-bytes, CPU int8/pruning)

Both winners (twins/canon, equiv/struct), same pattern:

| rung | bytes | twins test/OOD | equiv test/OOD |
|---|---|---|---|
| fp32 | 3.53 MB | .709 / .598 | .742 / .652 |
| fp16 | 1.78 MB | .709 / .598 | .742 / .652 |
| int8 dynamic | 1.92 MB | .709 / .597 | .742 / .652 |
| prune50+int8 | 2.19 MB | .703 / .594 | .719 / .631 |
| prune70+int8 | 1.31 MB | .610 / .566 | .628 / .613 |

- fp16 is free: 2x smaller, zero accuracy change. int8 is also free on
  accuracy but *larger* than fp16 here because dynamic quant only touches
  Linear layers — embeddings/positions stay fp32. At this scale the
  embedding table is the size problem, exactly the design doc's thesis.
- 50% sparsity costs ~1-2 pts; 70% breaks (-8 to -11 pts). Sparse index
  overhead (4B/nnz) means pruning only pays at high sparsity — and high
  sparsity is where accuracy dies. For tiny models: quantize, don't prune.

## Crash context (resolved by throttling)

Two CLOCK_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT (0x101) crashes coincided with the original
full-batch equiv/char runs. Throttled protocol (batch 128, one run at a
time, one compute domain at a time, 85C alarm) completed the entire queue
at a steady 58-60C with no incident. The throttle is now the house rule
for GPU work on this machine.

## Next

1. Two-channel encoding experiment (surface parse + canonical form as
   parallel inputs) — the equiv result says don't choose, expose both.
2. Grow the family-level concept vocabulary from the corpus; measure
   milestone 2 compression on real statement nodes rather than synthetic.
3. More disciplines (economics/finance: compound interest should family-
   twin exponential growth/decay).
